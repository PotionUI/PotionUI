# PotionUI

A self-hosted studio for generating images, video, and audio with diffusion
models. Pick a model, describe what you want, watch it come together in
real time.

## What you're looking at

- **Pick a model, get the right controls** — no wall of generic sliders and
  no hand-wiring: each model comes with a form showing only what it actually
  understands (resolution, camera angle, art style, whatever applies).
- **Watch it happen live** — step-by-step progress, streaming previews, and a
  gallery that fills in as results land.
- **One app for all of it** — images, video, and audio side by side, no
  per-model setup.

## The generate workspace

<!--
SCREENSHOT SLOT — GENERATE / VIDEO PRESET
A video preset selected (Wan or LTX), curated form visible (resolution,
frames, sampler), generation in progress with the live streaming preview
and a step progress bar mid-run.
-->

- Every tab is its own sandbox — preset, mode, prompts, and results — so you
  can run several ideas side by side without losing any of them.
- Switch models and the form swaps to match; the same tab handles txt2img,
  img2img, inpainting, or a video/audio mode.
- Like a setup? Save it as a **session** — preset, mode, prompts, and form
  values — and pull it back up any time.

## History, tags, and collections

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f46cde26-0288-4e05-ac90-c3be31f0d2dd

- Everything you generate is saved automatically, with the exact parameters
  that produced it.
- Tag generations to group and re-find them; bulk-delete by tag to clear out
  throwaway experiments.
- Sort work into collections, and compare two results side by side.

## Video Director

<!--
SCREENSHOT SLOT — VIDEO DIRECTOR
Video Director editor open on a Wan or LTX-2 preset, shot/section rail
populated with 2-3 sections (e.g. global + two timed/chain sections).
-->

- Build a shot out of **global, timed, and chained sections** instead of
  hand-managing separate prompt fields per segment.
- Same segment-card editor as everywhere else in PotionUI, aimed at a
  timeline.

## Music Director

<!--
SCREENSHOT SLOT — MUSIC DIRECTOR
Music Director editor open on the MiniMax-Music3 preset, a few sections
with lyrics/tags filled in.
-->

- Write verses and choruses as sections; the compiler turns them into
  MiniMax-Music3's tagged lyrics for you.

## Prompt tooling

<!--
SCREENSHOT SLOT — PROMPTS / PHRASEBOOK
Either the Prompts workspace (Segments tab with a few saved segments) or a
prompt editor mid-type with a Phrasebook autocomplete suggestion popup open
— whichever looks livelier.
-->

- **Segments** — save a prompt fragment once, drop it into any prompt; group
  related segments into templates.
- **Phrasebook** — autocomplete for known terms (art styles, camera angles,
  lighting) with per-chip shuffle for quick variation.
- **Dynamic prompts** — `{a|b}`, weighted choices, `${vars}`.
- **LLM enhancement** — optional, layered on the same editor.

## AI assistant

<!--
SCREENSHOT SLOT — CHAT ASSISTANT
LLM chat panel open beside the generate form, showing a pending tool-approval
prompt (e.g. a proposed phrasebook edit awaiting your confirmation).
-->

- Configure a language model and get an assistant beside generation: it
  brainstorms and rewrites prompts, edits phrasebook values, adjusts form
  state — **with your approval on every action that changes something**.
- The same tools are reachable from outside the app: PotionUI mints per-user
  [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) tokens, so an MCP
  client (Claude Desktop, an agent, your own tooling) can drive your instance
  directly.

## Multi-user, with an admin panel

<!--
SCREENSHOT SLOT — ADMIN
Admin area open on the Presets tab: preset list with installed status,
a preset selected showing the access assignment (users/groups) panel.
-->

PotionUI is built for more than one person on the same box:

- **Users and groups** — create accounts, group them, and assign presets,
  models, and LLM configurations per user or to a whole group at once.
- **Presets under control** — decide who sees which preset, and reshape any
  preset's form per mode: change defaults, lock fields, or hide them
  entirely, no YAML editing required.
- **Backends** — configure where generations run and let users pick between
  enabled backends.
- **LLM setup** — wire up the providers behind the assistant (Ollama,
  OpenRouter, …) and hand them out per user or group.
- **Models, plugins, settings** — manage installed models and downloads,
  toggle plugins, and set global options, all from the same panel.

The full tour: [docs/user/admin.md](docs/user/admin.md).

## Plugins

Nearly every subsystem is an extension point — even alternate inference
backends are plugins, not core code:

- **Providers** — credentialed connections to model marketplaces (e.g. CivitAI)
- **Backends** — configured instances of an inference engine (e.g. a ComfyUI server)
- **Pipes** — the individual steps a generation pipeline is built from
- **Field types, chat modes, frontend pages** — all pluggable

Plugin code imports only from `src/plugin_api/`. Authoring reference:
[docs/plugin-api.md](docs/plugin-api.md).

## Quickstart

You need:

- **Python 3.12+** and **Node.js 18+**
- For GPU generation: a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU with a matching PyTorch install
- Floor: **8 GB VRAM + 16 GB RAM** (runs the SDXL family). Larger families
  need more, some considerably more — see
  [Hardware Requirements](docs/user/hardware-requirements.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PotionUI/PotionUI.git potionui && cd potionui
./potionui doctor    # check prerequisites, with a repair command for anything missing
./potionui start     # create the venv, install deps, launch backend + frontend, print the URL
```

- `./potionui start` is idempotent and supervises both processes; `./potionui stop`
  or Ctrl-C cleans them up together.
- `./potionui status` reports whether an instance is up; `./potionui doctor`
  names any problem and its fix.
- No NVIDIA GPU on the host (e.g. a VPS pointed at a remote generation
  backend)? `./potionui start --no-gpu` skips the multi-GB CUDA stack.

### Supported platforms

| Platform                   | Status                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Linux x86_64 + NVIDIA CUDA | Tested and supported for 0.0.1       |
| Windows / WSL2             | Untested — community reports welcome |
| macOS                      | Untested — community reports welcome |
| AMD GPU (ROCm)             | Untested — community reports welcome |
| Docker                     | Supported — see below                |

```bash
docker run --gpus all -p 8005:8005 ghcr.io/potionui/potionui:latest
```

Requires an NVIDIA GPU +
[nvidia-container-toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit);
volumes and details in [`docker/README.md`](docker/README.md).
(`./potionui start-docker` runs the contributor-facing dev harness instead.)

### Running backend and frontend separately

Useful when iterating on one side only, or if `./potionui` doesn't fit your
setup:

```bash
# Backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt
python api.py                     # serves on http://localhost:8005

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                       # dev server on http://localhost:3001
```

Or run both together with `./run.sh` (assumes the venv and `node_modules` are
already installed — `./potionui start` does not):

```bash
./run.sh                          # backend :8005, frontend :3001
./run.sh 8005 3001 --lan          # also accept connections from the local network
```

## Documentation

- **[Getting started](docs/user/getting-started.md)** — first login to first
  image, plus the rest of the `docs/user/` guide.
- **Reference** in `docs/`: [presets](docs/presets.md),

  docs under `docs/models/` and `docs/techniques/`.

## Contributing

- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — dev setup, test and lint commands,
  PR expectations.
- `CLAUDE.md` — the deeper architecture reference; its package-layering rules
  are enforced by `tests/architecture/test_layering.py`, so boundary-crossing
  code fails CI.
- Security issue? See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
